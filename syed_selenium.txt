selenium1:

selenium RC- Remote control

selenium2:
RC- deprecated

Webdriver + selenium -> selenium 2

selenium 3:
Selenium IDE--> Firefox plugin (Play, pause, record)--> activity---whatever u are doing on a webpage--> it used to generate code

Webdriver---> module---> classes, functions which can be used to write selenium test cases

Selenium grid--> It was used to run test cases in parallel and on multiple browsers and on multiple machines
Hub--> start
Nodes---> register the nodes with the hub

Oct 2021--> selenium 4.0.0------4.7 till date


Selenium3:

1. selenium client: which will communicate to browser driver

Webdriver language bindings: Python, Java, javascript, perl, C
Everything is available in the form of REST apis
2. json wire protocol: 


3. browser driver: firefox, chrome, safari...etc---individual drivers for each driver ---chromedriver, geckodriver, edgedriver....exe files

4. Real browser: http request---perform actions on the web app

Selenium 4:

Json wire protocol ---deprecated

W3c protocol---encoding and decoding not necessary

1. Fast communication
2. Stability--same code used to run differently on different browsers---selenium issues/ errors
3. actions class modified---mouse actions---> newly introduced--> zoom in/out, press 2 keys from the keyboard at the same time
4. upgrade selenium grid:
hub/node separetely start earlier-----> in slenium4: no need to start them individually:
standalone mode: run a single jar file and it will take care of all the processes
hub and node:
Distributed mode: router, distributor, session and node-- individually run

5. deprecated desired capabilities:

Options class

chromeOptions
FirefoxOptions

6. improved window/ tab management:
multiple windows/tabs open through selenium---multiple instances were required earlier for webdriver to handle multiple windows, but in selenium 4---only one instance is req

7. upgrade selenium IDE:
earlier--> firefox plugin
now--> chrome  and ms edge also
SIDE runner--> Selenium IDE runner--> allows test cases to be executed from cmd and even on grid
